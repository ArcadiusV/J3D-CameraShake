Hello everyone!

I’m excited to share my very first script with you all! I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it. This script adds a touch of realism by shaking your camera during accidents to simulate the impact more vividly.

Key Features:
Realistic Camera Shake: Adds immersive effects during accidents.
Customizable Settings: You can adjust the intensity and set the speed thresholds to fit your preferences.
If you have any suggestions, feedback, or need help setting it up, feel free to reach out to me on Discord. I’m happy to assist with any questions or ideas you have!

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to hearing what you think!
